# hello world üçâ 

just your average coder who likes to build stuff

```javascript
// some things about me i guess
{
    currently: "probably coding listening to travis or jaden ",
    fun fact: "i debug by talking to rubber ducks",
}
```

## stuff i use
* whatever gets the job done, but usually:
* js/python when i'm feeling productive
* vs code when it's not crashing
* stackoverflow (let's be real)

## what i'm up to
* trying to write better code (aren't we all?)
* breaking things and fixing them
* learning new tech when the motivation hits
* building random projects at 3am after watching Silicon Valley

## my projects (the ones that actually work)
* [mnist gan](https://github.com/tveshas/mnist-gan) - it does something cool (i'm proud of this one)
* [planet simulation](https://github.com/tveshas/planet-stimulation) - this one almost works
* [that one project](https://github.com/tveshas/discord-reminder-bot) - we don't talk about this one (well i was 15)


## find me
* [twitter](https://x.com/liltvvv) : i usually post about science cats f1 tennis
* email: [tveshasingh@email.com] (hmu to create a project together (: )
* [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tvesha-singh/) :(because apparently we need this)
