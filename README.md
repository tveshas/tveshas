# hello world üçâ 

just your average coder who likes to build stuff

```javascript
// some things about me i guess
{
    currently: "probably coding listening to travis or jaden ",
    fun fact: "i debug by talking to rubber ducks",
}
```

## stuff i use
* whatever gets the job done, but usually:
* js/python when i'm feeling productive
* vs code when it's not crashing
* stackoverflow (let's be real)

## what i'm up to
* trying to write better code (aren't we all?)
* breaking things and fixing them
* learning new tech when the motivation hits
* building random projects at 3am after watching Silicon Valley

## my projects (the ones that actually work)
* [project name] - it does something cool
* [another project] - this one almost works
* [that one project] - we don't talk about this one (i was 15 üò≠)
